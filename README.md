# Liquid (and front matter for Jekyll) syntax for Sublime Text

Provides syntax highlighting for HTML and Markdown files that contain [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). 

For working with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), this package will also provide proper syntax highlighting for yaml front matter.

## Usage

To enable the syntax, select "Liquid > Liquid HTML" (or Markdown) from the syntax selection menu, or via the command palette. 
To always open your templates with this syntax, use the "Open all with current extension as ..." option, and select the proper Liquid syntax.
